HEALTHQUEST

HEALTH AND WELLBEING

Malaysia is experiencing a steady rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which are often linked to unhealthy lifestyles, poor diets, and lack of regular exercise. These conditions can largely be managed or even prevented through healthier living habits and regular medical check-ups, but many Malaysians struggle with maintaining consistent health monitoring. Busy lifestyles, lack of awareness, and inadequate access to health services contribute to the growing prevalence of these diseases.
A mobile app could serve as a personal health assistant, allowing users to easily track their health metrics and encouraging preventive health care. By integrating simple tools like step counting, water intake logs, and health reminders, the app would empower individuals to take control of their well- being. Additionally, the app could provide users with educational content on healthy living, helping to cultivate healthier habits that reduce the risk of NCDs.

we designed HealthQuest to be simple, guiding you step-by-step. Our custom 7-day plans help you build your goals gradually, like adding a little more water each day, until new habits feel natural. Every small step earns you levels and a sense of accomplishment—because success feels best when it’s built over time.
